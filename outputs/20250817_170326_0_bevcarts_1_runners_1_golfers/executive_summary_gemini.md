### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 100% (all orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 14.4 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 13.9 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 2 (delivered 2, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $50.00
- **Runner utilization**: 19.0% (time actively prepping or delivering)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Low order volume; runner was idle 81% of the time.
- **Breakeven for 2nd runner**: 3.1 orders/hour

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Demand was sparse, with one order placed mid-morning (9:48 AM) and another at midday (12:12 PM).
- The first order was placed 12 minutes before the runner's shift began at 10:00 AM, indicating a service availability gap for early golfers.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- **Promote delivery service to golfers — increase order volume to better utilize the runner.**
- **Align runner start time with first tee times — capture early-morning demand and improve service for the first golfers on the course.**
- **Maintain single-runner model — current capacity is sufficient until demand consistently approaches 3 orders per hour.**

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Runner utilization | 19.0% | n/a | Runner was idle for 81% of the shift, showing very low demand. |
| Avg order time | 13.9 min | < 15 min | Customer wait time from placement to delivery is excellent. |
| Revenue per round | $50.00 | n/a | The single ordering group generated significant revenue. |
| Orders per runner-hour | 0.82 | n/a | The runner handled less than one order per hour of active time. |
| On-time rate | 100% | > 95% | Service is highly reliable under current low-volume conditions. |
