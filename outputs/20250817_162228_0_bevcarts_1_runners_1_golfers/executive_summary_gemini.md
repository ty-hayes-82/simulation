### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 100.0% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 16.7 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 14.7 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 2 (delivered 2, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $50.00
- **Runner utilization**: 33.3% (time actively prepping or driving)
- **Primary bottleneck**: n/a (runner capacity sufficient for low demand)
- **Orders per runner-hour**: 1.35

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Demand was light and spread across the morning, with one order at 09:36 and another at 11:12.
- The first order was placed 24 minutes before the runner's 10:00 shift start, causing an initial queue and delaying service start.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Monitor order rate — Add a second runner if demand exceeds the break-even point of 1.8 orders/hour to maintain service levels.
- Analyze prep time — Investigate the fixed 10-minute prep time, as reducing it is the primary lever for improving service speed.
- Align runner start time with course activity — Start the runner's shift earlier to capture early orders and prevent initial queuing.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg order time | 14.7 min | n/a | Average customer wait from order placement to delivery. |
| On-time rate | 100.0% | n/a | Percentage of orders delivered within the SLA. |
| Runner utilization | 33.3% | n/a | Percent of time runner was actively prepping or driving. |
| Revenue per round | $50.00 | n/a | Total food and beverage revenue from a single golfer group. |
| Orders per runner-hour | 1.35 | < 1.8 | Orders processed per hour; nearing the threshold for a second runner. |
