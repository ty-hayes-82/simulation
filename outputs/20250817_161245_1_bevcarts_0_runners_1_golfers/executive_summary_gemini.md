### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **Orders**: 3 (direct sales)
- **Total revenue**: $36.00
- **Revenue per golfer**: $9.00 ($36 / 4 golfers)
- **Average order value**: $12.00
- **Avg order time**: n/a (direct sale model)
- **On-time rate**: n/a (direct sale model)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Cart path dependency (sales only occur at path intersections)
- **Runner utilization**: n/a (0 runners)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Sales occurred at the start of play (09:00) and then at regular two-hour intervals (10:59, 12:59), indicating consistent demand.
- Demand was distributed throughout the morning and early afternoon, with no single peak ordering hour observed in this run.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Introduce on-demand ordering with a runner — captures impulse buys between cart crossings to increase order volume.
- Simulate with additional golfer groups — evaluates system performance and cart capacity under more realistic, higher-load conditions.
- Test dynamic cart routing — potentially increases golfer interaction opportunities compared to the current fixed-loop path.
- Validate sales data logging for hole number — current data inaccurately logs all sales to hole 1, limiting spatial analysis.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Total Revenue | $36.00 | n/a | Total income generated from the beverage cart. |
| Revenue per Golfer | $9.00 | n/a | Average spend per person; a measure of penetration. |
| Average Order Value | $12.00 | n/a | The typical value of a single transaction. |
| Orders per Cart Hour | 0.38 | n/a | Cart's sales efficiency over its entire service shift. |
| Runner Utilization | 0% | n/a | No runners were used; all sales made directly from cart. |
