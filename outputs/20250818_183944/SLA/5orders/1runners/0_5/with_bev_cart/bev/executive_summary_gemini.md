### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **Total revenue**: $408.00
- **Total orders**: 34
- **Avg order value**: $12.00
- **Revenue per round**: $136.00
- **Order penetration rate**: 8.33% (golfer interactions resulting in a sale)
- **Orders per cart hour**: 3.78
- **Avg order time**: n/a
- **Primary bottleneck**: Cart coverage (indicated by 12.9 min per hole)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Sales demand was distributed throughout the service day, starting at 10:07.
- A mid-day peak occurred between 11:00–14:00, followed by a stronger demand spike in the evening (18:00–19:00).
- Significant sales continued late into the evening, with the final transaction at 21:29.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- **Capture order fulfillment time data** — measure customer wait time, a critical experience metric currently missing.
- **Ensure full stock for the evening shift** — capitalize on the observed 18:00 demand peak to maximize revenue.
- **Implement proactive selling techniques** — improve the low order penetration rate (8.33%) and increase overall sales.
- **Investigate zero delivery order conversions** — identify and address potential system friction or lack of golfer awareness.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Total Revenue | $408.00 | n/a | Total income generated from beverage cart sales. |
| Avg Order Value | $12.00 | n/a | The average amount spent per transaction. |
| Order Penetration Rate | 8.33% | n/a | Percentage of golfer interactions that converted to a sale. |
| Orders per Cart Hour | 3.78 | n/a | Cart sales efficiency per hour of operation. |
| Minutes per Hole | 12.9 min | n/a | Average time cart spends covering each hole; a proxy for pace. |
