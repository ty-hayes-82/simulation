# Executive Summary - Golf Course Simulation

**Generated by:** Google Gemini (gemini-2.5-pro)

### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **Revenue per round**: $113.00 (runner and bev cart combined)
- **On-time rate**: 100% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 22.8 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 14.8 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 11 (delivered 11, failed 0)
- **Primary bottleneck**: low order volume
- **Runner utilization**: 17.8% (time actively driving)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Order demand was low and spread throughout the day, with a small peak of three orders in the 14:00 hour.
- Runner service began at 10:00, missing the opportunity to serve golfers who started their rounds between 07:00 and 09:00.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Promote delivery service to golfers on the course — increases order volume to better utilize existing runner capacity.
- Start runner service earlier (e.g., 9:00 AM) — captures demand from morning golfers who currently have no service option.
- Assign secondary tasks to the runner during idle periods — improves labor efficiency given the high idle rate (82.2%).
