### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 100% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 25.4 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 21.4 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 2 delivered, 0 failed
- **Revenue per round**: $25.00
- **Primary bottleneck**: runner capacity
- **Runner utilization**: 45.3% (time actively prepping or driving)
- **Avg queue wait**: 4.0 min (wait before runner is assigned)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Peak demand occurred between 11:00–11:30 AM, with both orders placed within 17 minutes.
- The second order was placed while the runner was busy, creating a queue and an 8-minute wait before prep could begin.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Run simulations with higher order volume — validate system performance under stress, as current runner utilization is below 50%.
- Consider a second runner if demand exceeds 2.3 orders/hour — this is the calculated break-even point to maintain service levels.
- Investigate 10-minute prep time — reducing this could significantly decrease overall order time and increase runner capacity.
- Implement dynamic delivery estimates for customers — manage expectations by communicating potential delays when runners are already on a delivery.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg Order Time | 21.4 min | n/a | Average time from order placement to delivery. |
| Runner Utilization | 45.3% | n/a | Pct. of shift spent prepping or driving; indicates spare capacity. |
| On-time Rate | 100% | >95% | All orders delivered successfully within service levels. |
| Avg Queue Wait | 4.0 min | <5 min | Time an order waits for an available runner to start prep. |
| Orders per Runner-Hour | 1.09 | n/a | Runner efficiency; break-even for 2nd runner is 2.3. |
| Revenue per Round | $25.00 | n/a | Average revenue from each group that placed an order. |
