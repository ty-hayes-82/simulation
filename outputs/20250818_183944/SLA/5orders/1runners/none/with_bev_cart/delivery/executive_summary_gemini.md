### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **Revenue per round**: $105.00
- **On-time rate**: 88.9% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 31.3 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 18.3 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 9 (delivered 9, failed 0)
- **Primary bottleneck**: runner availability during peak demand
- **Runner utilization (driving)**: 19.4% (idle 80.6%)
- **Avg queue wait**: 19.2 min (time order waits for runner)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- A midday peak in orders (11:20 AM–1:00 PM) caused runner contention, with back-to-back orders resulting in significant queue delays for customers.
- The longest delivery time (31.3 min) occurred during this peak when a new order was placed while the single runner was occupied with a previous delivery.
- The delivery runner service opens at 10:00 AM, one hour after the beverage cart begins operating at 9:00 AM.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner during peak hours (11 AM–2 PM) — addresses the midday bottleneck, reducing queue times and improving customer experience.
- Assign secondary tasks to the runner during off-peak hours — leverages high idle time (80.6%) to improve labor efficiency.
- Analyze routes to distant holes (e.g., 5, 6, 18) — these locations have service times >19 min and create long delivery cycles, tying up the runner.
- Align runner start time with the beverage cart (9:00 AM) — captures potential early-morning order demand currently being missed.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg order time | 18.3 min | n/a | The typical customer wait time from order placement to delivery. |
| On-time rate | 88.9% | n/a | Percentage of orders delivered within the service level agreement. |
| Avg queue wait | 19.2 min | n/a | Average time an order waits for the runner, indicating contention. |
| Runner utilization | 19.4% | n/a | Percent of time runner is driving; high idle time suggests capacity. |
| Revenue per round | $105.00 | n/a | Total F&B revenue generated per golfer round from all services. |
