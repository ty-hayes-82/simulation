### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **Total revenue**: $300.00
- **Orders**: 25
- **Avg order value**: $12.00
- **Total tips**: $45.00 (proxy for service quality)
- **Order penetration rate**: 10.00%
- **Orders per cart hour**: 3.12 (cart efficiency)
- **Avg order time**: n/a
- **Primary bottleneck**: n/a (insufficient data)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Demand peaked in the late afternoon; 36% of all sales (9 of 25) occurred between 16:00 and 18:00.
- Sales were lowest in the early afternoon (12:00–14:00), with only two transactions recorded.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Restock cart before 16:00 — capitalize on the predictable afternoon sales peak and prevent stockouts.
- Implement order fulfillment time tracking — capture wait time data to identify service bottlenecks and improve customer experience.
- Trial on-cart promotions — increase the low 10% penetration rate and raise the average order value.
- Test a mobile pre-order system — capture demand from groups before the cart arrives, potentially smoothing operations and increasing sales.
