### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 60.0% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 48.8 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 28.2 min (typical customer wait)
- **Avg queue wait**: 16.3 min (time before prep)
- **Orders**: 11 (delivered 10, failed 1)
- **Revenue per round**: $27.78
- **Primary bottleneck**: runner capacity
- **Runner utilization**: 34.5% (time actively driving)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Peak demand occurred between 10:00–12:00, accounting for 80% of successful orders and creating a persistent service backlog.
- A surge of three simultaneous orders at 10:00 immediately overwhelmed the single runner, causing high initial queue times.
- Significant runner idle time was observed in the early afternoon between 12:30 and 13:45.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner during the 10:00–12:00 peak — to clear the morning backlog and improve on-time rates.
- Implement order batching for nearby locations — to increase delivery efficiency and runner capacity during demand surges.
- Analyze and optimize routes for distant holes (e.g., 18, 4) — to reduce long service times that tie up the runner.
- Consider a second runner once demand exceeds 5.7 orders/hour — the calculated breakeven point for profitability.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| On-time rate | 60.0% | n/a | The percentage of orders delivered within the service level agreement. |
| Avg order time | 28.2 min | n/a | The typical time a customer waits from order placement to delivery. |
| P90 delivery time | 48.8 min | n/a | The worst 10% of customers waited 48.8 minutes or longer. |
| Avg queue wait | 16.3 min | n/a | An order waits over 16 minutes before a runner starts preparation. |
| Revenue per round | $27.78 | n/a | Revenue generated from deliveries per complete round of golf played. |
