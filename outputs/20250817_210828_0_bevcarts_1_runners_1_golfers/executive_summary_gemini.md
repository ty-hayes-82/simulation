### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 100% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 20.8 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 20.3 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 2 (delivered 2, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $50.00
- **Primary bottleneck**: Runner capacity. The second order waited 8.7 minutes for the runner to return from the first delivery.
- **Runner utilization**: 24.6% (12.5% driving, 12.1% prepping)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Demand was sparse, with one order placed late-morning (10:00 AM) and another at midday (12:24 PM).
- The midday order experienced a significant queue delay, indicating that even infrequent, back-to-back orders can strain single-runner capacity during a return trip.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- **Monitor queue time** — a delay on only the second order highlights a potential bottleneck that will worsen with more volume.
- **Model increased order volume** — determine the service level impact as order frequency approaches the break-even point for a second runner (3.4 orders/hour).
- **Optimize runner workflow** — reduce the 20-minute delivery cycle by streamlining prep or routes to increase single-runner capacity before adding staff.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg order time | 20.3 min | n/a | The typical time from order placement to delivery. |
| On-time rate | 100% | n/a | Pct. of orders delivered within the service level agreement. |
| Runner utilization | 24.6% | n/a | Pct. of time the runner was actively preparing or delivering. |
| Avg queue wait | 4.4 min | n/a | Avg time an order waits for the runner to become available. |
| Orders per runner-hour | 0.73 | n/a | Runner throughput; a measure of operational efficiency. |
