### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 100% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 15.3 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 13.4 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 2 (delivered 2, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $50.00
- **Primary bottleneck**: Low order volume
- **Runner utilization**: 19.8% (time actively prepping or delivering)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- A one-hour service delay occurred for the first order, placed at 09:00 but serviced when the runner's shift began at 10:00.
- Order demand occurred in the morning (10:00 AM) and at noon (12:00 PM), with delivery times varying by location (11.5 min to Hole 1 vs. 15.3 min to Hole 16).

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- **Align runner start time with first tee time** — capture early demand and prevent initial service delays.
- **Run simulation with higher golfer density** — stress-test the system to find the true capacity of a single runner.
- **Maintain single-runner staffing model** — current order volume (0.89/hr) is well below the 2.8/hr break-even point for a second runner.
- **Focus on marketing to increase order volume** — boost revenue and improve runner efficiency, as current idle time is over 80%.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Runner utilization (active) | 19.8% | n/a | The runner was idle for 80.2% of the shift, indicating very low demand. |
| Avg order time | 13.4 min | n/a | The typical time from order placement to delivery for a customer. |
| Orders per runner-hour | 0.89 | >2.8 | Current rate is far below the volume needed to justify a second runner. |
| Revenue per round | $50.00 | n/a | The total F&B revenue generated by the single participating golfer group. |
| On-time rate | 100% | n/a | Service was perfectly reliable, with all orders delivered successfully. |
