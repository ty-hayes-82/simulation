### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 34.6% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 60.8 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 36.8 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 26 (delivered 20, failed 6)
- **Revenue per round**: $22.97
- **Primary bottleneck**: runner capacity
- **Runner utilization**: 34.1% (time actively delivering)
- **Failed order rate**: 21.1% (unfulfilled orders)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- An initial surge of orders at the 10:00 AM service opening creates a large, persistent backlog.
- Peak demand occurs between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM, resulting in long queue waits and a high rate of failed orders during this window.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner during peak hours (10 AM–2 PM) — to reduce queue times and capture revenue from failed orders.
- Investigate and clear delivery obstructions to holes 10–12 — to address long travel times identified in the simulation.
- Implement order batching for nearby holes — to increase runner efficiency and deliveries per hour.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg order time | 36.8 min | < 25 min | The typical customer wait from order to delivery. |
| On-time rate | 34.6% | > 85% | Percentage of orders delivered within the SLA. |
| Failed order rate | 21.1% | < 5% | Lost revenue due to unfulfilled orders. |
| P90 delivery time | 60.8 min | < 40 min | The worst 10% of customers waited over an hour. |
| Runner utilization | 34.1% | 50–70% | Time the runner is actively driving to deliver orders. |
