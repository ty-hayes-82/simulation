### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 34.8% (avg. orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 56.6 min (avg. worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 36.1 min (avg. customer wait)
- **Orders per run**: 30.8 (avg. placed, 21.0 delivered, 9.8 failed)
- **Failed order rate**: 31.4% (avg. unfulfilled orders)
- **Revenue per round**: $20.50 (mean)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Runner capacity
- **Runner utilization**: 30.3% (avg. time actively driving)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- A large burst of orders occurs at the 10:00 AM service opening, creating a large initial queue and causing a high number of failed orders.
- Demand peaks in the late morning (10:00 AM–12:00 PM), overwhelming the single runner and leading to the longest delivery times.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner during peak hours (10 AM–3 PM) — the single runner is overwhelmed, causing a 31.4% failed order rate; this would increase capacity and revenue.
- Stage a runner with popular items near the course turn (Holes 8–10) before 10 AM — reduces travel time for the initial order surge, improving morning delivery speed and success rates.
- Dynamically disable ordering when the active queue exceeds three orders — prevents creating orders likely to fail, managing customer expectations and reducing perceived service failures.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg order time | 36.1 min | < 20 min | Typical time from order placement to delivery. |
| Failed order rate | 31.4% | < 5% | Pct. of orders not fulfilled; lost revenue. |
| On-time rate | 34.8% | > 90% | Pct. of orders delivered within the SLA. |
| Runner utilization | 30.3% | n/a | Pct. of shift runner spends actively driving. |
| Revenue per round | $20.50 | Increase | Avg. delivery revenue per 18-hole round. |
