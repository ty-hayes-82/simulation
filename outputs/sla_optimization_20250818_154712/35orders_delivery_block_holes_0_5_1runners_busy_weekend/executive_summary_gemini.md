### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 48.0% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 55.2 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 33.2 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 137 (delivered 103, failed 34)
- **Failed order rate**: 24.8% (unfulfilled orders)
- **Revenue per round**: $23.19
- **Primary bottleneck**: runner capacity
- **Runner utilization**: 26.5% (time actively delivering)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- A significant demand spike occurs at 10:00 AM when service opens, creating an immediate and large order queue.
- Order volume remains high through the early afternoon (approx. 12:00 PM–3:00 PM), leading to sustained runner overload.
- The average initial queue wait of 25.1 minutes indicates the single runner is capacity-constrained from the start of the shift.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner during peak hours (10 AM–3 PM) — to handle demand spikes, reduce wait times, and cut failed orders.
- Implement proximity-based order batching — to increase delivery efficiency and orders per hour.
- Explore pre-ordering for early tee times — to smooth the 10:00 AM demand surge and reduce the initial queue backlog.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| On-time rate | 48.0% | >85% | Percentage of orders delivered within the target SLA. |
| Failed order rate | 24.8% | <5% | Percentage of unfulfilled orders, representing lost revenue. |
| Avg order time | 33.2 min | <25 min | The typical wait time from order placement to delivery for a customer. |
| P90 delivery time | 55.2 min | <35 min | Wait time for the worst-served 10% of customers; indicates service reliability. |
| Avg queue wait | 25.1 min | <10 min | Time an order waits before a runner begins preparation; a key bottleneck indicator. |
| Revenue per round | $23.19 | n/a | Average food and beverage revenue generated per group of golfers. |
