### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 42.3% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 58.9 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 35.8 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders (avg per run)**: 32 (delivered 23, failed 9)
- **Failed order rate**: 27.8% (orders cancelled due to delay)
- **Revenue per round**: $22.64
- **Primary bottleneck**: runner capacity
- **Runner utilization**: 31.9% (time actively delivering)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- A significant wave of orders is placed at the 10:00 AM service opening, creating an immediate backlog and overwhelming the single runner.
- Order queues frequently contained 3–8 waiting orders during peak periods, causing cascading delays throughout the late morning and early afternoon.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner during peak weekend hours — the single runner is capacity-constrained, causing a 27.8% failure rate and poor service.
- Implement order batching for nearby holes — improve runner efficiency (currently only 32% driving utilization) and reduce travel time per order.
- Stagger service opening or offer pre-ordering — mitigate the 10:00 AM order surge that creates an immediate and persistent system backlog.
- Analyze delivery routes to distant or slow-to-service holes — reduce travel time variance and improve predictability for the worst-served zones.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| On-time rate | 42.3% | >85% | Percentage of orders delivered within the service level agreement (SLA). |
| Avg order time | 35.8 min | <30 min | The typical time a customer waits from placing an order to receiving it. |
| P90 delivery time | 58.9 min | <45 min | 90% of customers wait this long or less; the worst 10% experience. |
| Failed order rate | 27.8% | <5% | Orders cancelled due to delays, representing lost revenue and poor experience. |
| Runner utilization | 31.9% | n/a | Time the runner is actively driving; low value suggests efficiency gains are possible. |
