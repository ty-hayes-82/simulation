### At-a-glance
- **On-time rate**: 49.2% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 56.2 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 32.2 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders placed**: 117 (delivered 100, failed 17)
- **Failed order rate**: 14.5% (unfulfilled orders)
- **Revenue per round**: $25.03
- **Primary bottleneck**: Runner capacity
- **Runner utilization**: 28.0% (time actively delivering)

### Time-of-day patterns
- A significant order spike occurs at the 10:00 AM service opening, creating an immediate and persistent queue.
- Demand remains high from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM, consistently straining runner capacity and leading to extended delivery times and failed orders.

### Recommendations — next actions
- Add a second runner during peak hours — to reduce queue times, decrease the 14.5% failed order rate, and capture more revenue.
- Stagger the service opening or introduce pre-ordering — to smooth the initial 10:00 AM demand spike and prevent immediate system overload.
- Implement dynamic delivery estimates — to manage customer expectations during busy periods and improve satisfaction despite long waits.
