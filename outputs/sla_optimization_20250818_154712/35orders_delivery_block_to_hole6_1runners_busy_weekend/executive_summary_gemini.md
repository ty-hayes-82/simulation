### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 42.9% (avg orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 53.3 min (avg worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 33.9 min (avg typical customer wait)
- **Orders per run**: 28 (avg delivered 21, failed 7)
- **Revenue per round**: $23.25 (avg)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Runner capacity
- **Runner utilization**: 30.4% (avg time actively delivering)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- A significant demand spike occurs at 10:00 AM across all simulations when the delivery service opens.
- This initial order surge consistently overwhelms the single runner, causing extended queue times and a high concentration of failed orders within the first hour of service.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner during peak hours (10 AM–2 PM) — addresses the capacity bottleneck to reduce failures and improve wait times.
- Implement order batching for nearby holes — increases runner efficiency and delivery throughput during demand spikes.
- Offer incentives for placing orders before 10 AM or after 1 PM — smooths demand to better align with the capacity of a single runner.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| On-time rate | 42.9% | n/a | Percentage of orders delivered within the SLA. |
| Avg order time | 33.9 min | n/a | The typical time a customer waits for an order. |
| P90 delivery time | 53.3 min | n/a | 1 in 10 customers wait this long or longer. |
| Failed order rate | 24.1% | n/a | Unfulfilled orders, representing lost revenue. |
| Runner utilization | 30.4% | n/a | Time runner spent actively driving for deliveries. |
