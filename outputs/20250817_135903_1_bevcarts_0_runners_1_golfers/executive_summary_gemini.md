### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **Revenue per round**: $4.00
- **Total orders**: 1
- **Avg order value**: $12.00
- **Order penetration rate**: 33%
- **Orders per cart hour**: 0.11
- **Primary bottleneck**: Cart coverage speed
- **Cart speed**: 30.0 min per hole

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- The single purchase occurred at 09:26, just 26 minutes after the 09:00 tee time, at the first point of interaction on Hole 1.
- No further sales were recorded, indicating a potential lack of interaction between the cart and the golfer group for the remainder of the round.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- **Optimize cart route —** The cart's pace of 30 minutes per hole is extremely slow, limiting golfer interactions; a revised path could increase sales opportunities.
- **Simulate with more golfer groups —** A single-group test provides insufficient data to identify broader demand patterns or validate operational models.
- **Evaluate dynamic routing —** Test a model where the cart responds to golfer locations instead of a fixed loop to increase service convenience and capture more sales.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue per Round | $4.00 | n/a | Average spend per golfer over their entire round. |
| Orders per Cart Hour | 0.11 | n/a | Cart sales velocity; a low value indicates low efficiency. |
| Minutes per Hole per Cart | 30.0 min | n/a | Cart coverage speed; a high value indicates a slow pace. |
| Order Penetration Rate | 33% | n/a | Percentage of groups purchasing upon interaction. |
| Avg Order Value | $12.00 | n/a | The average transaction size for each sale. |
