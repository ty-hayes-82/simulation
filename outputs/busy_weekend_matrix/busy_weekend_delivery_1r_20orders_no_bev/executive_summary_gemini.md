### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 100% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 22.8 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 16.7 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 30 (delivered 30, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $29.96
- **Primary bottleneck**: single runner capacity during demand spikes
- **Runner utilization**: 34.6% (time on active tasks)
- **Second runner justified**: after 12.5 orders per shift

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Service opens at 11:00 AM, with order demand concentrated in the late morning and early afternoon.
- Clustered orders within short windows overwhelm the single runner, creating significant order queues and subsequent delivery delays despite low overall utilization.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner during peak hours (11 AM – 3 PM) — to eliminate queuing, reduce delivery times, and increase revenue capacity.
- Analyze service routes for consistently slow holes (e.g., Hole 7) — to identify optimization opportunities and improve runner efficiency.
- Establish a formal 30-minute delivery SLA — to set clear customer expectations and a firm target for operational performance.
- Pilot off-peak promotions — to smooth demand, increase overall runner utilization, and provide more consistent service.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg order time | 16.7 min | <25 min | The typical customer wait is fast but masks underlying queue delays. |
| P90 delivery time | 22.8 min | <30 min | The worst 10% of experiences are acceptable but at risk from order clustering. |
| Runner utilization | 34.6% | 70–85% | The runner is underutilized between demand spikes, suggesting a scheduling issue. |
| On-time rate | 100% | >95% | Perfect record based on current metrics, but a formal SLA is needed. |
| Revenue per round | $29.96 | n/a | Key profitability metric; can be increased by improving capacity. |
