### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 81.6% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 41.0 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 22.2 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 28 (delivered 28, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $28.04
- **Primary bottleneck**: Runner capacity during high-volume periods
- **Runner utilization**: 32.1% (time actively delivering, prepping, or waiting)
- **2nd runner break-even**: 12.5 orders (threshold exceeded in high-demand run)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Performance is highly sensitive to demand clustering. The system failed when multiple orders were placed within minutes (e.g., Run 1, 11:34 AM–11:40 AM), causing queue delays to exceed 19 minutes.
- Service levels remained high (100% on-time) when order demand was more evenly distributed throughout the day, even with long delivery times to distant holes.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner during peak hours (e.g., 11:30 AM–2:30 PM) — Exceeding the 12.5 order break-even threshold with one runner significantly degrades service.
- Batch orders for distant, high-service-time holes (e.g., Hole 4, Hole 6) — Grouping deliveries can reduce runner travel time and improve overall system throughput.
- Investigate low runner utilization (32.1%) — A low utilization rate for a primary bottleneck suggests significant idle or inefficient prep/wait time that needs to be optimized.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg order time | 22.2 min | < 25 min | The typical time a customer waits from order to delivery. |
| On-time rate | 81.6% | > 90% | Percentage of orders delivered within the service level agreement. |
| P90 delivery time | 41.0 min | < 40 min | The worst 10% of customers wait this long or longer for delivery. |
| Revenue per round | $28.04 | n/a | Average incremental revenue generated per golfer round. |
| Orders per runner-hour | 1.4 | n/a | Measures runner efficiency over an active shift. |
