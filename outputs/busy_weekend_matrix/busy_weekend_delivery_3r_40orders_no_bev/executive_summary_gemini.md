### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **Revenue per round**: $31.88
- **On-time rate**: 100% (all orders delivered within SLA)
- **Avg order time**: 14.6 min (typical customer wait)
- **P90 delivery time**: 16.9 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Orders (avg per run)**: 28 (delivered 28, failed 0)
- **Runner utilization (active driving)**: 16.5%
- **Primary bottleneck**: Order demand (runner capacity is underutilized)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Delivery service operates from 11:00 AM, with orders placed consistently until 6:00 PM.
- Peak demand occurs between 1:00 PM and 2:00 PM, accounting for 23% of total orders.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Reduce runner count from 3 to 2 for similar demand days — low runner utilization (<17% active) and zero queue wait time indicate excess capacity.
- Test a 2-runner simulation with this order volume — validates that service levels can be maintained while significantly reducing labor costs.
- Stimulate demand with targeted promotions, especially from 11 AM to 1 PM — capitalizes on idle runner capacity to increase revenue.
- Model the impact of adding beverage sales — could increase order volume and value, providing a better justification for current staffing.
