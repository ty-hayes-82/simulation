### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 29.0% (avg orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 55.3 min (avg worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 36.4 min (avg typical customer wait)
- **Order failure rate**: 40.8% (avg orders not delivered)
- **Revenue per round**: $16.46
- **Runner efficiency**: 1.6 orders/hour (avg)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Single runner capacity, unable to meet demand.
- **Orders (avg/run)**: 27 placed (16 delivered, 11 failed)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Demand peaks sharply between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, with multiple orders frequently placed at once, creating an immediate service backlog.
- Deliveries to distant holes (e.g., 13, 15) take up to 60 minutes, monopolizing the single runner and causing cascading failures for subsequent orders across the course.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner during peak hours (11 AM–3 PM) — A single runner is overwhelmed by demand (avg 27 orders vs. 12.5 break-even point), causing a high failure rate. Expected impact: Increase delivery capacity, lower wait times, and capture more revenue.
- Implement order batching for nearby holes — The current one-order-per-trip model is inefficient for managing simultaneous demand. Expected impact: Improve runner efficiency (orders/hour) and reduce average travel time per delivery.
- Temporarily limit service to the most distant holes during peak demand — These long-duration deliveries create significant backlogs for all other customers. Expected impact: Improve the on-time rate for the majority of orders and reduce system-wide failures.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg order time | 36.4 min | n/a | The typical time a customer waits from order to delivery. |
| On-time rate | 29.0% | n/a | Percentage of orders delivered within the SLA. |
| Order failure rate | 40.8% | n/a | Percentage of placed orders not successfully delivered. |
| Revenue per round | $16.46 | n/a | Average F&B revenue generated per 18-hole round played. |
| P90 delivery time | 55.3 min | n/a | The worst 10% of customers waited this long or longer. |
