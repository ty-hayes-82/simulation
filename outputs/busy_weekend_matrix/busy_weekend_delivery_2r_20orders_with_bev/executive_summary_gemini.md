### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 97.9% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 25.0 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 17.3 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 45 (delivered 45, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $28.87 (from on-course delivery)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Runner capacity during peak demand bursts.
- **Runner utilization**: 16.3% (time actively delivering)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Delivery demand begins immediately at the 11:00 AM service start and is concentrated around the midday lunch period.
- A significant demand spike with multiple simultaneous orders occurred around 12:45 PM in one run, creating a temporary queue and extending wait times for subsequent orders.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a flex runner for the 12:00 PM–2:00 PM window — mitigates the peak demand bottleneck to reduce queue times and improve service consistency.
- Analyze delivery routes for high-service-time holes (e.g., 4, 5, 9, 13) — identify potential shortcuts to reduce the longest delivery times and increase runner availability.
- Investigate the fixed 10-minute order prep time — reducing this internal delay would directly lower overall customer wait times and increase runner throughput.
- Promote the service to golfers teeing off before 11:00 AM — aims to smooth demand by capturing orders earlier in the day, ahead of the lunch rush.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg order time | 17.3 min | < 20 min | The typical time a customer waits for an order. |
| On-time rate | 97.9% | > 95% | Percentage of orders delivered within the SLA. |
| P90 delivery time | 25.0 min | < 30 min | The longest wait time experienced by 90% of customers. |
| Orders per runner-hour | 2.25 | n/a | Measures the combined efficiency of the two runners. |
| Runner utilization | 16.3% | n/a | Percentage of shift time runners spend actively driving. |
