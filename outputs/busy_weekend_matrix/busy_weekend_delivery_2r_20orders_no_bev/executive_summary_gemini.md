### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 100.0% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 18.3 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 15.1 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 28 (delivered 28, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $27.96
- **Primary bottleneck**: Runner capacity during peak order clusters
- **Runner utilization**: 10.3% (time actively driving for delivery)
- **Second runner breakeven**: 12.5 orders (threshold met in both runs)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Order demand is concentrated between 11:30 AM and 2:00 PM, creating temporary delivery backlogs.
- Simultaneous order placement occurs during peak hours, immediately engaging both runners and causing queue delays for any subsequent orders.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Stagger runner shifts to ensure overlapping coverage during the 11:30 AM–2:00 PM peak — aligns runner availability with demand spikes, reducing order queue times.
- Offer minor discounts for orders placed before 11:30 AM — incentivizes golfers to order early, smoothing the demand curve and improving runner efficiency.
- Analyze routes to distant holes (e.g., Hole 4, Hole 12) for potential shortcuts — reduces the longest delivery times and improves overall service speed.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg order time | 15.1 min | n/a | Average customer wait from order to delivery. |
| On-time rate | 100.0% | >95% | System is reliable; no orders missed their SLA. |
| P90 delivery time | 18.3 min | <25 min | The longest 10% of deliveries are still timely. |
| Runner utilization (driving) | 10.3% | n/a | Percent of shift time runners spend driving; low value suggests high idle capacity outside of peaks. |
| Revenue per round | $27.96 | n/a | Average F&B revenue generated per golfer group. |
| Failed orders | 0 | 0 | All orders placed were successfully delivered. |
