### At-a-glance (7 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 97.5% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 22.9 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 15.5 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 38 (delivered 38, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $27.22
- **Primary bottleneck**: runner capacity during demand peaks
- **Runner utilization**: 30.3% (time in prep or driving)

### Time-of-day patterns (3 bullets)
- Demand spikes at the 11:00 AM service opening, with 21% of daily orders placed in the first hour, causing initial delays.
- A secondary, smaller demand peak occurs between 16:00–17:00 as golfers play the final holes.
- Hole 4 consistently shows the longest delivery times (avg. 29.8 min), significantly tying up runner capacity and impacting service for other orders.

### Recommendations — next actions (3 bullets)
- Add flexible runner coverage for peak hours (11:00–13:00) — absorbs demand spikes to reduce queue times and improve customer experience.
- Investigate and optimize the delivery route to hole 4 — reducing its long service time will free up runner capacity and decrease system-wide delays.
- Offer a small discount for orders placed in off-peak hours (12:00–15:00) — smooths the demand curve to better utilize existing runner capacity.
