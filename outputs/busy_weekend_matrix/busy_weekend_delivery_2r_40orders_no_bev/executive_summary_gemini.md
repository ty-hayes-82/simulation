### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **Revenue per round**: $29.51 (average across runs)
- **Avg order time**: 15.8 min (typical customer wait)
- **P90 delivery time**: 22.0 min (worst 10% experience)
- **On-time rate**: 100% (all orders delivered within SLA)
- **Orders**: 46 (delivered 46, failed 0)
- **Runner utilization**: 31.7% (time driving or waiting for orders)
- **Primary bottleneck**: None; runner capacity exceeds current demand.
- **2nd runner break-even**: 12.5 orders (daily threshold)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Delivery service operates from 11:00 AM, aligning with mid-round demand.
- Order volume peaks between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM, with a secondary increase in the late afternoon.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Test a one-runner scenario — validates if service levels are maintained while halving labor costs, given low utilization.
- Align runner shifts with peak demand (11 AM–1 PM) — matches staffing to observed order patterns to improve efficiency.
- Investigate low order volume vs. simulation target (23 vs. 40) — identifies potential friction in the ordering process or lack of golfer awareness.
- Analyze service times for distant holes (e.g., Hole 11, 28.5 min) — informs potential for batching orders or setting location-based delivery time expectations.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg order time | 15.8 min | n/a | Typical customer wait from order to delivery. |
| Revenue per round | $29.51 | n/a | Average incremental revenue per golfer round. |
| Runner utilization | 31.7% | n/a | Percent of time runners were active; low value indicates overcapacity. |
| Orders per runner-hour | 2.3 | n/a | A measure of runner efficiency during active hours. |
| Failed order rate | 0.0% | < 1% | All orders were successfully delivered. |
