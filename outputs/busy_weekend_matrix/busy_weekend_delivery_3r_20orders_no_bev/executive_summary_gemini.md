### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 100% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 17.7 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 15.6 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 24 (delivered 24, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $27.35
- **Runner utilization**: 84.5% (time actively working)
- **Primary bottleneck**: runner capacity (indicated by consistent queue times)
- **Avg queue wait**: 2.8 min (time orders wait for a runner)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Order demand peaks between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, shortly after the 11:00 AM service opening.
- Runner queue delays begin with the first few orders and persist, showing the 3-runner system is immediately capacity-constrained during demand periods.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Simulate a 4-runner scenario — High utilization (84.5%) and immediate order queuing indicate the system is at capacity; adding a runner should reduce wait times.
- Analyze staggering runner start times — Aligning more runner availability with the 12-2 PM peak could improve efficiency without increasing total labor hours.
- Investigate prep time reduction — The fixed 10-minute prep is a large part of the delivery cycle; process improvements could increase runner throughput.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg Order Time | 15.6 min | n/a | The typical time a customer waits from order to delivery. |
| On-Time Rate | 100% | n/a | Percentage of orders delivered within SLA; currently perfect. |
| Runner Utilization | 84.5% | n/a | Percentage of time runners are busy; high value signals a bottleneck. |
| Avg Queue Wait | 2.8 min | n/a | Average time an order waits for a runner; a direct measure of capacity strain. |
| Revenue per Round | $27.35 | n/a | Average incremental revenue per golfer group from on-course sales. |
| P90 Delivery Time | 17.7 min | n/a | The experience of the worst 10% of orders; a measure of service consistency. |
