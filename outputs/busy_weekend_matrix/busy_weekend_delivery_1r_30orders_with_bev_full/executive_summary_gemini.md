### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **Failed order rate**: 65.1% (avg. across two runs)
- **On-time rate**: 46.4% (avg. for delivered orders)
- **P90 delivery time**: 51.5 min (avg. worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 32.8 min (avg. customer wait)
- **Orders (total)**: 43 placed, 9 delivered, 28 failed
- **Revenue per round**: $6.79 (avg. from delivery service)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Runner capacity and misaligned service hours.
- **Runner utilization**: 61.4% (avg. time actively delivering)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Order placement begins as early as 07:12, but delivery service does not start until 11:00, creating a significant service gap.
- A large backlog of orders accumulates and floods the system at the 11:00 opening, overwhelming the single runner immediately.
- This initial failure cascade prevents the runner from catching up, leading to high failure rates throughout the day.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Start runner service at 09:00 — aligns with golfer demand, prevents order backlog, and improves on-time delivery.
- Add a second runner during peak hours (11:00–14:00) — increases capacity to meet demand, reduces failed orders, and captures lost revenue.
- Re-evaluate the 1-hour SLA for orders placed before service opens — manages customer expectations and avoids guaranteed failures.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Failed order rate | 64.7% | <10% | The majority of orders fail, representing critical service and capacity issues. |
| On-time rate | 46.4% | >90% | Fewer than half of successful deliveries meet the service promise. |
| P90 delivery time | 51.5 min | <30 min | The worst 10% of customers wait nearly an hour for delivery. |
| Avg order time | 32.8 min | <20 min | The typical wait time is high, even for successful orders. |
| Revenue per round | $6.79 | n/a | Average delivery revenue captured per golfer group on the course. |
