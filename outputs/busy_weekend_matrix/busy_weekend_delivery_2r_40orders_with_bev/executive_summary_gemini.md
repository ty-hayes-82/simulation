### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 93.6% (avg orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 29.2 min (avg worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 18.9 min (avg typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 63 (delivered 63, failed 0 across 2 runs)
- **Revenue per round**: $32.04 (avg from delivery)
- **Runner utilization**: 39.4% (avg time active on orders)
- **Primary bottleneck**: runner capacity during peak demand, causing order queues.
- **Second-runner break-even**: 12.5 orders (daily threshold)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Delivery demand begins at 11:00 AM and peaks between 11:30 AM and 2:30 PM, coinciding with lunch hours and causing temporary order backlogs.
- Delivery runners start service at 11:00 AM, two hours after the beverage cart begins operations at 9:00 AM.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a third runner during the 11:30 AM–2:30 PM peak — to reduce queue delays, lower P90 delivery times, and improve customer experience.
- Test an earlier runner start time (e.g., 10:00 AM) — to capture potential morning demand and align service hours with the beverage cart.
- Analyze delivery routes for high-service-time zones (e.g., Hole 3) — to identify path optimizations that reduce travel time and increase capacity.
- Investigate queue wait time reporting — to ensure summary metrics accurately reflect operational performance during peak periods.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg order time | 18.9 min | n/a | The typical time a customer waits from order to delivery. |
| On-time rate | 93.6% | n/a | Percentage of orders delivered within the service level agreement. |
| P90 delivery time | 29.2 min | n/a | The delivery experience for the worst-performing 10% of orders. |
| Runner utilization | 39.4% | n/a | Percentage of shift time runners were actively working on orders. |
| Revenue per round | $32.04 | n/a | Average incremental revenue from delivery per round of golf. |
