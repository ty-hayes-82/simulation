### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 100.0% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 18.3 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 15.1 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 51 (delivered 51, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $203.63 (combined bev cart and delivery)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Order prep time (fixed at 10 min)
- **Runner utilization**: 36.8% (time actively prepping and delivering)
- **Orders per runner-hour**: 2.6

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Delivery service operates from 11:00, with demand concentrated in the afternoon.
- Order volume peaks between 13:00 and 16:00, with the highest demand occurring around 15:00.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Reduce fixed 10-min prep time — this is the primary service bottleneck and the largest component of delivery time.
- Re-evaluate staffing from 3 to 2 runners — low utilization (~37%) and zero average queue wait indicate excess capacity.
- Stagger runner start times to align with peak afternoon demand (post-13:00) — this optimizes labor costs by matching capacity to demand.
- Analyze delivery routes to distant holes (e.g., 4, 12, 13) for efficiencies — this could reduce the worst-case P90 delivery times.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg order time | 15.1 min | n/a | Typical customer wait from placement to delivery. |
| On-time rate | 100% | n/a | Percentage of orders delivered within service level agreement. |
| P90 delivery time | 18.3 min | n/a | Wait time for the worst 10% of orders. |
| Runner utilization | 36.8% | n/a | Percent of shift runners are actively working. |
| Revenue per round | $203.63 | n/a | Average F&B spend per foursome across all services. |
| Orders per runner-hour | 2.6 | n/a | Measures individual runner throughput and efficiency. |
