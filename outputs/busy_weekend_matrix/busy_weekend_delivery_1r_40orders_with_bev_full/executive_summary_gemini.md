### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **Failed rate**: 46.6% (avg orders unfulfilled due to capacity)
- **On-time rate**: 50.0% (avg orders delivered within SLA)
- **Avg order time**: 31.2 min (avg customer wait for successful orders)
- **P90 delivery time**: 45.5 min (avg worst 10% experience)
- **Orders**: 36.5 (delivered 2, failed 17, pending 17.5, avg)
- **Revenue per round**: $1.79 (avg delivery revenue)
- **Primary bottleneck**: runner capacity (single runner overwhelmed)
- **Runner utilization**: 31.9% (avg time actively driving)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- The delivery service opens at 11:00, four hours after the first tee time (07:00), creating an immediate backlog of over 10 orders.
- This initial demand surge overwhelms the single runner, causing a cascade of failures as order SLAs expire before they can be serviced.
- The system never recovers from the backlog, resulting in consistently poor performance throughout the day.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Align runner service start time with first tee time (07:00) — eliminates the initial order backlog and drastically reduces early-morning failures.
- Simulate adding a second runner during peak hours — increases capacity to meet demand, as the break-even point is only 12.5 orders.
- Analyze delivery routes for batching opportunities — reduces runner travel time per order, increasing overall throughput and service speed.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Failed Rate | 46.6% | < 10% | Nearly half of all orders fail, indicating severe capacity issues and lost revenue. |
| Avg Order Time | 31.2 min | < 20 min | The typical wait for a successful delivery is excessively long for customers. |
| On-time Rate | 50.0% | > 90% | Only half of the few successful orders meet the service promise. |
| Orders per Runner-Hour | 0.2 | > 1.5 | Extreme inefficiency; the runner completes only one order every five hours. |
| Total Delivered Orders | 2 | > 20 | The system is capturing a fraction of potential demand, fulfilling only 2 of ~37 orders. |
