### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 38.9% (avg. orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 58.1 min (avg. worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 39.4 min (avg. customer wait)
- **Orders**: 43 (delivered 27, failed 16)
- **Revenue per round**: $18.42 (avg. for runner service)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Single runner capacity
- **Runner utilization**: 19.3% (avg. time actively driving)
- **Second-runner break-even**: 12.5 orders (demand consistently exceeds this)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Delivery service starts at 11:00 AM, missing four hours of potential demand from golfers who tee off starting at 7:00 AM.
- Order demand concentrates after opening, immediately overwhelming the single runner, which causes cascading delays and a high order failure rate.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner during peak hours (e.g., 11 AM–3 PM) — reduce wait times and failed orders as demand exceeds the 12.5 order break-even threshold.
- Start runner service earlier, at 9:00 AM — capture unmet morning demand and better distribute the order load across the day.
- Review the order failure SLA/timeout — the average failure rate of 37.2% is unsustainably high and indicates a misalignment between service promise and capacity.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg Order Time | 39.4 min | < 25 min | Average customer wait from order to delivery. |
| Failed Order Rate | 37.2% | < 5% | Pct. of unfulfilled orders due to capacity limits. |
| On-Time Rate | 38.9% | > 85% | Pct. of orders delivered within the SLA. |
| Delivery Revenue per Round | $18.42 | > $25 | Runner service contribution per golfer group. |
