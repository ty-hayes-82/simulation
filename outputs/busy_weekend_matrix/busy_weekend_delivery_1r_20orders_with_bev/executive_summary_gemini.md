### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 61.9% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 54.0 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 29.5 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 21 (delivered 21, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $30.88 (delivery only)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Runner capacity
- **Runner utilization**: 39.7% (13.2% driving, 26.5% waiting for prep/dispatch)
- **2nd runner needed**: At 12.5 orders (21 received)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Delivery demand began at 11:30 and remained steady, but service quality degraded significantly as the day progressed.
- Orders placed after 3:00 PM experienced completion times exceeding 45 minutes as the single runner's queue grew.
- Service times to distant holes (13, 11, 7) consistently exceeded 40 minutes, compounding the capacity bottleneck.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner for peak shifts — Demand (21 orders) exceeded the break-even threshold of 12.5, causing poor service; will improve on-time rates.
- Analyze long delivery times for distant holes — Explore batching orders or creating forward staging areas to reduce excessive travel time.
- Review the fixed 10-minute prep time per order — This consumed 3.5 hours of runner time; streamlining prep would increase delivery capacity.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| On-Time Rate | 61.9% | n/a | Percentage of orders delivered within the service level agreement. |
| P90 Delivery Time | 54.0 min | n/a | The worst 10% of customers waited 54 minutes or more. |
| Avg Order Time | 29.5 min | n/a | The typical customer wait time from order to delivery. |
| Orders per Runner-Hour | 2.1 | n/a | Runner efficiency; deliveries completed per active hour. |
| 2nd Runner Break-Even | 12.5 orders | n/a | A second runner is justified after this volume; 21 orders were placed. |
