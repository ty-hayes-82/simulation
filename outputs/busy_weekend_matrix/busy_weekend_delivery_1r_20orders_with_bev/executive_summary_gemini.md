### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 65.5% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 46.9 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 24.6 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 27 (delivered 26, failed 1)
- **Revenue per round**: $26.00 (avg runner revenue per ordering group)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Single runner capacity and long travel distances
- **Runner utilization**: 12.1% (time actively driving)
- **Second runner profitable**: Yes (avg 13 delivered orders > 12.5 break-even)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Runner service opens at 11:00 AM, two hours after the beverage cart, missing potential demand from golfers who teed off between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM.
- Order volume concentrates after the 11:00 AM start, creating an immediate backlog that strains the single runner's capacity.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner — Exceeding the 12.5 order break-even point justifies the cost to improve service times and capture failed orders.
- Align runner start time with bev cart at 9:00 AM — Capture early-round demand and distribute orders more evenly to reduce the 11:00 AM peak.
- Analyze routes for distant holes (e.g., 3, 5, 10) — Service times to these holes exceeded 30 minutes; route optimization could lower wait times.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| On-time Rate | 65.5% | >90% | Over a third of customers receive orders later than promised. |
| Avg Order Time | 24.6 min | <30 min | The typical customer experience is acceptable but risks dissatisfaction. |
| P90 Delivery Time | 46.9 min | <45 min | The worst 10% of customers experience unacceptably long waits. |
| Failed Order Rate | 3.7% | <5% | Revenue loss from failed orders is minimal but indicates capacity strain. |
| Orders per Runner-Hour | 1.3 | >2.5 | Low throughput is driven by single-order trips and long travel distances. |
