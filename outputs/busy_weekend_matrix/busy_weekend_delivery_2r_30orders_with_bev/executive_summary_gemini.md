### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 100.0% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 25.1 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 17.1 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 54 delivered, 0 failed
- **Revenue per round**: $30.63 (delivery only)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Runner capacity exceeds current demand
- **Runner utilization**: 18.4% (time actively delivering)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Delivery service begins at 11:00 AM, missing potential revenue from golfers teeing off between 7:00–9:00 AM.
- Zero average queue time for orders indicates the two-runner team is sufficient for current demand patterns, leaving capacity for growth.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Expand service hours to 9:00 AM — capture untapped demand from morning golfers and increase revenue.
- Launch targeted on-course promotions — increase order volume to better utilize existing runner capacity.
- Analyze routes to distant holes (e.g., 5, 11, 13) — identify efficiencies to reduce outlier delivery times.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg Order Time | 17.1 min | < 20 min | The typical customer wait time from order to delivery. |
| On-Time Rate | 100.0% | > 95% | Percentage of orders delivered within the service level agreement. |
| Runner Utilization | 18.4% | n/a | Percent of time runners are driving; low value indicates idle capacity. |
| Revenue per Round | $30.63 | n/a | Average delivery-specific revenue generated per foursome. |
