### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 54.8% (avg orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 51.7 min (avg worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 31.1 min (avg customer wait)
- **Orders**: 49 placed (delivered 33, failed 15 over 2 runs)
- **Revenue per round**: $19.13 (mean)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Runner capacity; order volume exceeded the 12.5 order break-even threshold for a second runner.
- **Runner utilization**: 71.0% (avg time not idle)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Delivery service opens at 11:00 AM, but demand peaks significantly between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM.
- Over 65% of all orders were placed during this three-hour window.
- The high rate of failed orders and extended delivery times directly corresponds to this midday demand surge.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner during peak hours (11 AM–3 PM) — to increase capacity, improve on-time rates, and capture revenue from failed orders.
- Align runner shifts with demand (e.g., 10:30 AM start) — to reduce idle labor costs and maximize coverage during peak hours.
- Analyze delivery routes for distant holes (e.g., 6, 9, 11) — as their long service times disproportionately reduce overall system capacity.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| On-time rate | 54.8% | >90% | Only half of orders arrive on time, indicating poor service reliability. |
| Avg order time | 31.1 min | <25 min | The typical customer waits over 30 minutes from order to delivery. |
| Failed order rate | 30.6% | <5% | Nearly one-third of orders are unfulfilled, losing significant revenue. |
| P90 delivery time | 51.7 min | <40 min | The worst 10% of customers wait nearly an hour for their delivery. |
