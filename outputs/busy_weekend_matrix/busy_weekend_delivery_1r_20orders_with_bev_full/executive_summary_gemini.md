### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 57.8% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 56.7 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 29.4 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 32 placed (delivered 14, failed 15)
- **Revenue per round**: $11.97
- **Primary bottleneck**: runner capacity
- **Runner utilization**: 46.1% (time actively delivering)
- **Second runner break-even**: 12.5 orders

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- The runner's 11:00 AM start, four hours after the first 7:00 AM tee time, created an immediate and unmanageable backlog of orders.
- This initial queue overwhelmed the single runner, leading to a cascade of failed orders as they could not catch up with subsequent demand.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Align runner start time with the first hour of play — to prevent initial order backlog and improve on-time rates.
- Add a second runner for weekend shifts — to meet demand that exceeds the single-runner capacity of 12.5 orders.
- Investigate high service times to specific holes (e.g., Hole 1) — to identify and fix potential routing or process inefficiencies.
- Establish a formal on-time delivery SLA target (e.g., >90%) — to create a clear benchmark for operational performance.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Failed Order Rate | 46.9% | <10% | Nearly half of orders were unfulfilled, representing lost revenue and poor service. |
| Avg Order Time | 29.4 min | <20 min | The typical customer waited almost 30 minutes from order to delivery. |
| On-Time Rate | 57.8% | >90% | Just over half of successful deliveries met the service level agreement. |
| P90 Delivery Time | 56.7 min | <30 min | The worst 10% of customers waited nearly an hour for their order. |
| Runner Utilization | 46.1% | 75-85% | The runner was active less than half the time, suggesting process inefficiency despite high demand. |
