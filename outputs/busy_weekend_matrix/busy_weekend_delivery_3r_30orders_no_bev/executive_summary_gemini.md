### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 100.0% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 17.8 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 14.7 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 19 (delivered 19, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $25.69
- **Primary bottleneck**: None; significant excess runner capacity.
- **Runner utilization**: 24.6% (time active or waiting for orders)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Order demand is concentrated in a midday peak, with most orders placed between 11:30 AM and 2:00 PM.
- The first order occurs approximately 30 minutes after the 11:00 AM service start, indicating a slow start to the delivery window.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Reduce staffing to 2 runners — current demand of 19 orders is well below the capacity of 3 runners (24.6% utilization), reducing labor costs without service impact.
- Stimulate demand during shoulder hours (pre-12 PM, post-2 PM) — leverage significant idle runner capacity to increase order volume and total revenue.
- Investigate the 30-minute service lag — understand why orders begin ~11:30 AM, not at the 11:00 AM opening, to capture potential early demand.
