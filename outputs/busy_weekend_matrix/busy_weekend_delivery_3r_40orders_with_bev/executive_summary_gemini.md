### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 100% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 17.9 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 15.6 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 67 (delivered 67, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $260.64 (combined bev cart and delivery)
- **Primary bottleneck**: runner capacity
- **Runner utilization**: 20.4% (time actively delivering)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Delivery service operates from 11:00 AM to approximately 6:00 PM, aligning with peak course occupancy.
- Order demand is highest and most consistent between 12:00 PM and 3:00 PM, representing the primary stress period for the delivery operation.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- **Reduce staff to 2 runners on weekends** — utilization is low (~20%) and queue wait is zero, suggesting excess capacity and an opportunity to cut labor costs without impacting service.
- **Investigate long service times for distant holes (e.g., Hole 4, 8)** — analyze routes or potential staging locations to reduce delivery times for outliers and improve overall efficiency.
- **Integrate beverage cart sales with the delivery platform** — the cart generates high revenue but zero delivery conversions, indicating a missed opportunity to upsell items not stocked on the cart.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Avg order time | 15.6 min | < 20 min | The average time a golfer waits from order placement to delivery. |
| On-time rate | 100% | > 95% | Percentage of orders delivered within the service level agreement (SLA). |
| Runner utilization | 20.4% | n/a | Percentage of time runners are actively driving; a measure of labor efficiency. |
| Orders per runner-hour | 3.35 | n/a | The number of orders a single runner completes in an hour of service. |
| Failed order rate | 0% | < 1% | Percentage of orders that could not be fulfilled, indicating system reliability. |
