### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **Order failure rate**: 63.8% (unfulfilled delivery requests)
- **On-time rate**: 50.0% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 56.0 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 32.2 min (typical customer wait)
- **Delivery revenue per round**: $7.50
- **Primary bottleneck**: Runner capacity
- **Runner utilization**: 53.3% (time driving or waiting for prep)
- **Second-runner break-even**: 12.5 orders (demand averaged 31)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- Delivery demand peaks between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM, immediately overwhelming the single runner and causing a cascade of order failures.
- Runner service starts at 11:00 AM, two hours after the beverage cart (9:00 AM), missing an early window for potential demand and revenue.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Add a second runner — break-even is 12.5 orders, well below demand, which will significantly reduce failures and wait times.
- Align runner start time with the beverage cart (9:00 AM) — capture two hours of missed early-morning demand.
- Implement order batching for nearby holes during peak hours — improve runner efficiency to increase overall success rate.
- Analyze and optimize runner routes — reduce high average travel distances to increase hourly delivery capacity.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Order Failure Rate | 63.8% | <15% | Percentage of delivery orders that could not be fulfilled. |
| On-Time Rate | 50.0% | >85% | Orders delivered within the service level agreement (SLA). |
| P90 Delivery Time | 56.0 min | <45 min | The worst 10% of customers waited this long or more. |
| Avg Order Time | 32.2 min | <30 min | The typical wait time from order placement to delivery. |
| Runner Utilization | 53.3% | n/a | Percentage of time the runner is actively working. |
| Delivery Revenue / Round | $7.50 | n/a | Incremental revenue from the delivery service per round played. |
