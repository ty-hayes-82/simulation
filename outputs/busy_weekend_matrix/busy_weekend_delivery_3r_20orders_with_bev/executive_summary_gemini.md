### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **On-time rate**: 100% (orders delivered within SLA)
- **P90 delivery time**: 17.3 min (worst 10% experience)
- **Avg order time**: 14.4 min (typical customer wait)
- **Orders**: 19 avg (delivered 19, failed 0)
- **Revenue per round**: $215.88 (all sources, mean)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Runner over-staffing for current demand
- **Runner utilization**: 11.5% (time actively delivering)

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- All delivery orders were placed after the 11:00 AM service start time, concentrating demand in the afternoon.
- Brief periods of runner congestion and order queuing occurred despite low overall daily utilization, indicating a mismatch between staffing levels and demand timing.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Reduce runners from three to two — current demand (avg 19 orders) does not justify a third runner, improving cost-efficiency.
- Promote the delivery service actively — drive higher order volume via app or on-tee signage to better leverage runner capacity.
- Stagger runner start times — align staffing with the post-11:00 AM demand peak to reduce idle hours while maintaining service levels.
