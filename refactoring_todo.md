# Refactoring Follow-up TODO

- [ ] Confirm the simulation runs successfully after the refactoring.
- [ ] Review the output files from the new simulation run to ensure correctness and consistency.
  - [ ] `summary.md`
  - [ ] `delivery_runner_metrics_run_01.json`
  - [ ] `delivery_runner_metrics_run_01.md`
  - [ ] `order_logs.csv`
  - [ ] `events.csv`
- [ ] Analyze `coordinates.csv` to verify that the runner and golfer paths are correctly synchronized at the delivery point.
- [ ] Provide a final summary of the findings to confirm the fix is working as expected.
