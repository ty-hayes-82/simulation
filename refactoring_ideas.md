# Refactoring and Simplification Ideas for `golfsim/simulation/services.py`

After analyzing `golfsim/simulation/services.py`, here are the top ideas for refactoring and simplification. These changes would improve the code's structure and maintainability without altering its logic.

### 1. Introduce a `BaseDeliveryService` Class

**Problem:** The `SingleRunnerDeliveryService` and `MultiRunnerDeliveryService` classes share a significant amount of boilerplate and common logic, leading to code duplication. This includes configuration loading, travel distance fetching, and activity logging.

**Solution:** Create a `BaseDeliveryService` class to contain all the shared attributes and methods. `SingleRunnerDeliveryService` and `MultiRunnerDeliveryService` would then inherit from this base class.

**Benefits:**
*   **Reduces Duplication:** Consolidates common code in one place.
*   **Improves Maintainability:** Changes to shared logic only need to be made in the base class.
*   **Clarifies Service-Specific Logic:** The child classes would only contain the logic that is unique to them (e.g., single vs. multi-runner dispatching).

**Common code to move to `BaseDeliveryService`:**
*   Attributes like `env`, `course_dir`, `clubhouse_coords`, `service_open_s`, etc.
*   Methods like `_load_course_config()`, `_load_travel_distances()`, `_calculate_delivery_details()`, and `_time_str_to_seconds()`.

### 2. Extract and Centralize Utility Functions

**Problem:** The file contains utility functions that are either duplicated across different classes or could be used elsewhere in the codebase. For example, `_haversine_m` is defined in both `MultiRunnerDeliveryService` and `BeverageCartService`.

**Solution:** Move general-purpose functions to a shared utility module, such as `golfsim/utils.py`.

**Candidate functions:**
*   `_haversine_m`: A standard geospatial distance calculation.
*   `_load_connected_points`: Logic for loading and parsing specific geojson files.
*   `_time_str_to_seconds`: A simple time conversion utility.

**Benefits:**
*   **Reusability:** Makes these functions available to other parts of the application.
*   **Single Source of Truth:** Avoids inconsistencies between different implementations of the same function.

### 3. Refactor Complex Routing Logic

**Problem:** The `_process_single_order` method in `MultiRunnerDeliveryService` contains complex logic for determining the delivery route. The current implementation is hard to read and maintain.

**Solution:** Encapsulate the routing logic in a new, dedicated method, for example `_calculate_delivery_route(self, order)`. This method should be responsible for calculating the best path using the node index from the course graph. It must not contain any fallback routing strategies. If a path cannot be determined for any reason, the method should fail loudly by raising an exception.

**Benefits:**
*   **Improved Readability:** The main `_process_single_order` method would become much cleaner, focusing on the high-level steps of order processing.
*   **Easier Testing:** The routing logic can be tested in isolation.
*   **Robustness:** Failing loudly ensures that routing issues are surfaced immediately instead of being hidden by fallback logic.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The logic for *how* to find a route is separated from the logic of *what to do* with the route.

### 4. Move Order Generation Logic

**Problem:** The `simulate_golfer_orders` function, which is responsible for generating order lists, is located in `services.py`. Its purpose is distinct from the simulation services themselves.

**Solution:** Move `simulate_golfer_orders` to the existing `golfsim/simulation/order_generation.py` file. This would group it with other related logic for creating simulation inputs.

**Benefits:**
*   **Better Organization:** Improves the logical structure of the simulation module.
*   **Cohesion:** Keeps all order generation logic in one place.

### 5. Split `services.py` into Multiple Files

**Problem:** At over 1600 lines, `services.py` is very large and contains multiple, distinct high-level classes (`SingleRunnerDeliveryService`, `MultiRunnerDeliveryService`, `BeverageCartService`). This makes the file difficult to navigate and understand.

**Solution:** As a larger refactoring step, split the file into smaller, more focused modules within the `golfsim/simulation/` directory:

*   `delivery_service_base.py` (for the new base class)
*   `single_runner_service.py`
*   `multi_runner_service.py`
*   `beverage_cart_service.py`

**Benefits:**
*   **Improved Navigation:** It's easier to find the code for a specific service.
*   **Enhanced Maintainability:** Smaller files are simpler to work with and review.
*   **Clearer Dependencies:** Makes the relationships between different parts of the simulation more explicit.
