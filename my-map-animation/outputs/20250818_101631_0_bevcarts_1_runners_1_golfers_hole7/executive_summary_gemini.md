---

### At-a-glance (6–8 bullets)
- **Avg order time**: 14.6 min (customer wait from order to delivery)
- **Orders**: 1 (delivered 1, failed 0)
- **Primary bottleneck**: Kitchen prep time (10 min of 14.6 min wait)
- **Runner utilization**: 3.8% (time actively on delivery during 4-hour round)
- **Delivery travel time**: 4.6 min (one-way from kitchen to golfer)
- **Total delivery distance**: 1471 m (round trip)
- **Revenue per round**: n/a

### Time-of-day patterns (2–3 bullets)
- The single order was placed on hole 7, approximately 84 minutes into the 4-hour round.
- This scenario suggests potential for early-round demand, though more data is required to confirm a pattern.

### Recommendations — next actions (3–5 bullets)
- Reduce kitchen prep time — it comprises 68% of the customer's wait and is the primary service bottleneck.
- Stimulate order demand on the front nine — runner utilization was very low, indicating significant spare capacity.
- Run higher-density simulations — a single order does not adequately stress-test system capacity or reveal scaling issues.
- Maintain the current predictive algorithm — location prediction was highly accurate, ensuring efficient runner routing.

### KPIs with context (table, ≤6 rows)
| Metric | Value | Target | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| Average Order Time | 14.6 min | n/a | Total customer wait from order to delivery. |
| Kitchen Prep Time | 10.0 min | n/a | Time until food is ready for runner pickup. |
| Delivery Travel Time | 4.6 min | n/a | One-way travel time from kitchen to golfer. |
| Runner Utilization | 3.8% | n/a | Percent of the 4-hour round the runner was active. |
| Orders Delivered | 1 | n/a | Total completed orders during the simulation. |
