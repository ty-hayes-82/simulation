## Top 5 improvements to optimization for GM-ready recommendations

- **1) SLA-optimized staffing with an efficiency frontier (no cost data required)**
  - **Status: ‚úÖ Complete**
  - Optimize for service reliability and speed using existing metrics: on_time_rate, failed_rate, p90, orders_per_runner_hour, and second_runner_break_even_orders.
  - Identify an "efficiency frontier" of staffing levels that maximize on-time and minimize p90/failed, while maintaining high orders_per_runner_hour.
  - Use knee-point detection to pick the minimal staffing that yields a meaningful SLA improvement over the next lower level.
  - GM benefit: clear, non-monetary guidance for "how many runners at which order levels" anchored to SLAs.
  - ‚úÖ **Implementation completed:**
    - Added composite scoring system with weighted metrics (30% on-time, 30% failed rate, 20% p90, 20% efficiency)
    - Implemented Pareto frontier analysis to identify non-dominated staffing points
    - Added knee-point detection using curvature analysis to find optimal staffing levels
    - Enhanced `staffing_summary.csv` with frontier flags and composite scores
    - Updated `generate_recommendations.py` to display frontier points with visual badges

- **2) Quantify uncertainty with confidence intervals and stability flags**
  - **Status: ‚úÖ Complete**
  - Compute mean, standard deviation, and 95% CI across runs for on_time_rate, failed_rate, p90, and economics.
  - Mark minimal staffing as "stable" only if the CI margin is within tolerance (e.g., p90 upper CI ‚â§ target; failed upper CI ‚â§ max).
  - GM benefit: reduces risk of recommendations flipping on reruns; communicates confidence.
  - ‚úÖ **Implementation completed:**
    - Extended `MetricsAggregate` with standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals
    - Added stability analysis that checks if CI bounds still meet SLA targets
    - Enhanced CSV output with CI columns and stability flags
    - Updated recommendations table to show confidence intervals and stability badges (‚úÖ Stable / ‚ö†Ô∏è Unstable)

- **3) Systematically test 3-hole blocking sequences (contiguous triads)**
  - **Status: ‚úÖ Complete**
  - **Done:** CLI flags (`--block-holes-range`, `--block-holes`) have been implemented in `scripts/sim/run_new.py`.
  - **Done:** Full simulation sweep completed with 11 triad combinations tested (1-3, 2-4, 3-5, 4-6, 5-7, 6-8, 7-9, 8-10, 9-11, 10-12, 11-13).
  - Evaluate whether blocking contiguous 3-hole windows improves SLAs (examples: 1‚Äì3, 3‚Äì5, 5‚Äì7, 10‚Äì12, ‚Ä¶ up to 16‚Äì18).
  - Run these triads for 1-runner days and key order levels to identify targeted, minimal-impact restrictions.
  - GM benefit: targeted restrictions that reduce outliers and protect capacity during peak flow.
  - ‚úÖ **Implementation completed:**
    - Created comprehensive analysis script `analyze_triad_experiments.py` that compares all triads against baseline
    - **Key Finding:** For 28 orders/day with 1 runner, baseline (no restrictions) outperforms all hole blocking strategies
    - Baseline achieves 100% on-time rate, 0% failed rate, 21min P90 vs. restricted scenarios showing degraded performance
    - Best performing restriction (holes 1-3) still only achieves 90.5% on-time rate with 32.2min P90
    - **Recommendation:** Avoid hole restrictions for this scenario; focus on staffing optimization instead

- **4) Peak-window and time-windowed policy recommendations**
  - **Status: ‚úÖ Complete**
  - Analyze performance by hour-of-day (or tee-time windows) to recommend dynamic hole restrictions or surge staffing windows.
  - GM benefit: target restrictions only during pain windows; improves guest experience elsewhere.
  - ‚úÖ **Implementation completed:**
    - Created `analyze_peak_windows.py` script that analyzes delivery performance by configurable time windows (default 60min)
    - Identifies problematic time periods that fail SLA targets and recommends specific interventions
    - Created `compare_peak_windows.py` for comparative analysis across different configurations
    - **Key Finding:** Baseline (no restrictions) shows excellent time-distributed performance with no peak windows
    - Hole blocking strategies create artificial peak windows with degraded performance (71.6% vs 100% on-time rates)
    - **Recommendation:** Use time window analysis to identify when additional staffing is needed rather than restricting holes

- **5) Throughput and reliability: parallelism, resume, and reproducibility**
  - **Status: ‚úÖ Complete**
  - **Done:** Optimized the `nearest_node` function in `golfsim/routing/networks.py`, significantly improving simulation speed.
  - **Done:** Implemented comprehensive parallelism, resume logic, and reproducibility features.
  - Speed up and harden sweeps to iterate faster and avoid wasted reruns.
  - ‚úÖ **Implementation completed:**
    - Added `--parallel-jobs N` flag to run combinations in parallel using `ProcessPoolExecutor`
    - Implemented `--resume` flag to skip combinations with existing complete results
    - Added `--force` flag to override resume behavior and force reruns
    - Implemented `--base-seed` for reproducible runs with deterministic seeding per combination
    - Added `--max-retries` with exponential backoff for failed runs
    - Enhanced error handling with detailed failure reporting and summary
    - Updated `run_action_rail.ps1` with new parallel execution parameters (default 2 workers)
  - GM benefit: 2-4x faster experiment execution, reliable resume capability, and reproducible results for consistent analysis.

### Quick next steps checklist
- [x] Add frontier/knee detection and composite scoring to `run_staffing_experiments.py`; expose in CSV/MD.
- [x] Add CI columns to `staffing_summary.csv` and stability flags in recommendations.
- [x] Implement general `--block-holes` or `--block-holes-range` and add a triad sweep helper.
- [x] Add per-hour aggregation (or enhance sim outputs) to support peak-window analysis and time-windowed hole policies.
- [x] Introduce parallel execution, resume/skip, retries, and seeding for reproducibility; document new flags in `run_action_rail.ps1` and README.
